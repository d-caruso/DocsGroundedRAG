# Retrieve a Checkout Session's line items

When retrieving a Checkout Session, there is an includable **line\_items** property containing the first handful of those items. There is also a URL where you can retrieve the full (paginated) list of line items.

## Returns

A dictionary with a `data` property that contains an array of up to `limit` Checkout Session line items, starting after Line Item `starting_after`. Each entry in the array is a separate Line Item object. If no more line items are available, the resulting array will be empty.

## Parameters

- `ending_before` (string, optional)
  A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.

- `limit` (integer, optional)
  A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.

- `starting_after` (string, optional)
  A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
